# functional-NN

The code for the functional neural network methods used in this study is named new_fos.universal.nonlinear.R, adapted from the following article:

Luo R, Qi X. Nonlinear function-on-scalar regression via functional universal approximation. Biometrics. 2023;79(4):3319-3331. doi:10.1111/biom.13838

In the functional_NN.R article, we demonstrate how to perform regression analysis on the mortality patterns across regions in China using functional neural networks. We also provide the code for permutation importance, SHAP values, and ALE visualizations of the neural network results. Additionally, we offer the data used for analysis in an .xlsx file.
